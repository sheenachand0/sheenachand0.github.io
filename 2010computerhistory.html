      <li>2010: Apple unveils the iPad, changing the way consumers view media and jumpstarting the dormant tablet computer segment.</li>

<li>2011: Google releases the Chromebook, a laptop that runs the Google Chrome OS.</li>

<li>2012: Facebook gains 1 billion users on October 4.</li>

<li>2015: Apple releases the Apple Watch. Microsoft releases Windows 10.</li>

<li>2016: The first reprogrammable quantum computer was created. "Until now, there hasn't been any quantum-computing platform that had the capability to program new algorithms into their system. They're usually each tailored to attack a particular algorithm," said study lead author Shantanu Debnath, a quantum physicist and optical engineer at the University of Maryland, College Park.</li>

<li>2017: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is developing a new "Molecular Informatics" program that uses molecules as computers. "Chemistry offers a rich set of properties that we may be able to harness for rapid, scalable information storage and processing," Anne Fischer, program manager in DARPA's Defense Sciences Office, said in a statement. "Millions of molecules exist, and each molecule has a unique three-dimensional atomic structure as well as variables such as shape, size, or even color. This richness provides a vast design space for exploring novel and multi-value ways to encode and process data beyond the 0s and 1s of current logic-based, digital architectures."
