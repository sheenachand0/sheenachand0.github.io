      Kevin Love says the response to his first-person essay in which he shared his panic attack episode from earlier in the Cleveland Cavaliers' season and opened up about how he looks after his mental health has been "overwhelming" and has him considering
      continuing to spread the message as his "life's work."</p>

      "It's been amazing," Love said at Cavs shootaround Wednesday morning before their game against the Denver Nuggets. "After that November game against the Hawks, I felt I needed to address something and look inward for myself, but also I thought yesterday
      was a great chance to be able to help people, and that's why I set out to do it. I didn't realize that the response would be like it was or like it is. It's amazing what we're able to do with this platform, but like I mentioned, everybody is going
      through something. Everybody has things that you can't see, that you can't touch that they're walking around with every day."

   "I mentioned it doesn't discriminate, but in a lot of ways young men and young boys are pretty far behind. That was pretty apparent yesterday in talking to guys and talking to someone like Jose [Calderon], who sits next to me on the plane. There's a lot of follow-ups to this. Overwhelming is a good word to use, and also I mean that in a positive way, a positive connotation. I'm just trying to read through all the emails, all the texts and respond to everybody in the right way. There's a lot of work to be done, but I'm really glad this is out there and I'm really glad I can help."
