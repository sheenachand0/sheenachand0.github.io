    <H1>Spreading message on mental health may become Kevin Love's 'life's work'

      Kevin Love says the response to his first-person essay in which he shared his panic attack episode from earlier in the Cleveland Cavaliers' season and opened up about how he looks after his mental health has been "overwhelming" and has him considering
      continuing to spread the message as his "life's work."</p>
    <P>
      "It's been amazing," Love said at Cavs shootaround Wednesday morning before their game against the Denver Nuggets. "After that November game against the Hawks, I felt I needed to address something and look inward for myself, but also I thought yesterday
      was a great chance to be able to help people, and that's why I set out to do it. I didn't realize that the response would be like it was or like it is. It's amazing what we're able to do with this platform, but like I mentioned, everybody is going
      through something. Everybody has things that you can't see, that you can't touch that they're walking around with every day."

      "I mentioned it doesn't discriminate, but in a lot of ways young men and young boys are pretty far behind. That was pretty apparent yesterday in talking to guys and talking to someone like Jose [Calderon], who sits next to me on the plane. There's a lot
      of follow-ups to this. Overwhelming is a good word to use, and also I mean that in a positive way, a positive connotation. I'm just trying to read through all the emails, all the texts and respond to everybody in the right way. There's a lot of
      work to be done, but I'm really glad this is out there and I'm really glad I can help."

      Raptors' DeMar DeRozan amazed by support over his depression

      He may be an Olympic gold medallist, an NBA all-star, and the face of the Toronto Raptors, but DeMar DeRozan has never experienced anything like the outpouring of support he's received since speaking publicly about his ongoing struggle with depression.
      "The last week has been one of the most incredible things that I've witnessed. Period," said DeRozan on Tuesday after Toronto's 106-90 win over the Atlanta Hawks. "Me being who I am and the response and everything I got back from it, it's been so
      positive. "It made me feel pretty damn good."
    </P>
    <P>
      DeRozan tweeted: "This depression get the best of me." on Feb. 17 while he was in his hometown of Los Angeles for the NBA All-Star Game. That led to the normally reserved DeRozan opening up to Toronto reporters, getting into details about his issues.
      His words affected NBA rival Kevin Love of the Cleveland Cavaliers so much that Love called DeRozan an inspiration in an essay he wrote on his own mental health problems on Tuesday for The Players' Tribune.
    </P>
    <p>
      "It made me feel great, that was my whole intent with speaking out," said DeRozan when asked about Love's article. "I understand it's hard to step up and do a thing like that. If I had to be the sacrificial lamb to open up that gate and make everybody
      else feel comfortable and share their story and help the next person, that's what it's all about."

      Kelly Oubre Jr. joins NBA players sharing mental health struggles: ‘We’re normal people, man’

    <P>
      In the wake of DeMar DeRozan describing his battle with depression and Kevin Love sharing the story of the in-game panic he experienced last November in a personal Players’ Tribune essay, Kelly Oubre Jr. joined the chorus of NBA players speaking out about
      mental health. The Wizards’ 22-year-old forward said he can “100 percent” relate to DeRozan and Love’s recent comments, which have drawn praise and support from the NBA community and beyond.
    </P>
    <p>
      “We’re normal human beings,” Oubre told NBC Sports Washington’s Chase Hughes on this week’s “Wizards Tipoff” podcast. “We face a lot more adversity, and a lot more problems and struggles as a normal human being. It’s a little bit more amped up, we just
      can’t show it. I’m really good at keeping a poker face because when I was growing up, my dad always told me, ‘Don’t let anybody see you weak.’ Nobody sees that I’m weak, but deep down inside, I am going through a lot, and Hell is turning over. …
      I just go in a quiet place and breathe, man. Just being mindful is the only way I know how to get through any anxiety, any depression or anything like that. That s— is serious, and I feel like people who are on the outside looking in don’t really
      understand because they see us as superheroes, but we’re normal people, man. We go through the issues that normal people go through times 10.”

      “A lot of times, things can get overwhelming. I want to be great now, and when I play bad, I’m a little harder on myself than I should be. He’s there to calm me down. Mental health is definitely something that he always preaches. He worries about me keeping
      my head, because obviously I’m crazy as hell. I love him, because he’s there and he wants to see me be great.”
